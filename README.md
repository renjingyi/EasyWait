# EasyWait
This study is interested in addressing the scheduling problems for the restaurants, finding the best solution to arrange the groups from the outside waiting line to be seated at the restaurant inside tables, and meanwhile achieving not only the improvements of the restaurant customersâ€™ satisfaction, which is from the view of reducing their waiting time, but also the boost of the restaurant daily income by increasing the number of people that the restaurant has served. A simulation system is designed to accomplish the idea and consists of three parts: the random data generation, the scheduling methods implementation and the method performance evaluation. It generates random discrete time-series sequence, applies three scheduling methods, measures each method performance and gives a comprehensive suggestion for the system users. This study proposes three scheduling methods, the First Come First Serve, the Size Matching, and the Group Priority Serving, and gives the results of the experiments for comparing and analyzing the methods.

`1. The folder includes all codes that the contributer writes. It would be a complete and runable java system. 

`2. The Power Point file is the instruction from the zero of this problem to the final product.

`3. The other pictures are the additional illustrations of the system design, the code flow and also the method implementations.
